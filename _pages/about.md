I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate studying [Linguistics at Georgetown University](https://linguistics.georgetown.edu/). 

Before coming to Georgetown, I earned an MA in Slavic Linguistics at The Ohio State University, where I also indepedently taught Russian language courses for two years. My master's thesis investigated the social perceptions of non-native accents in Russian.

My current research centers on the field of sociophonetics. As a sociophonetician, I explore the intricate relationship between social cues and their impact on both speech perception and production. I am also interested in the phenomenon of speech convergence, the process through which speakers align their speech patterns at various phonetic levels. 

Most recently, for my dissertation work, I am designing experiments to assess bilingual and L2 speakers' speech perception as a function of beliefs on a model talker's native langauge status.

🏃‍♀️💃🏞 When I am not working, I enjoy ballroom dancing, running, and hiking in the countryside.
